1. make a small button footer in each measurement screen section so buttons do not overlap measurement texts. If needed, make buttons narrower
2. experiment setting page, make labels for input field explaining the meaning
3. when i try to save the experiment settings, device restarts
4. All wi-Fi text should be Wifi

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.All measurements command button footer is over the measurement values section. This section should be lifted
2.Stopwatch should have the same uniform command button footer
3.Command button footer texts should fit in the buttons. Make text smaller. 
4.Measurement buffer list items have two order numbers currently. That needs to be correccted.
5.UA measurement shows only ueros for acceleration in the measurement buffer.
6. Can you show a proper m/s2 power of two?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Experiment settings input value descritions/labels are still not shown/missiong
2. Remove armed duration on screen counter for all 
3. Lift the result texts a bit up so they do not go below the comannd button footer
4. Make the sumulation buttons smaller, shorter, to gain more space for the measurement screen section
5. comannd button footer buttons are wider than the command footer, make the buttons closer to each other so there is no scroolin needed
6. Stopwatch, animate the start stop button green. Make the buffer value section higer, all the way to the page header
7. Stopwatch buffer should also show last value at the top
8. Write m/s2 like that until we resolve the superscript issue
9. Make the experiment setting screen keyboard check button do the same as save button, and return to the measurement screen. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Hide wifi indication if wifi is disabled
2. Experiment settings input value descritions/labels are still not shown - why?
3. Stopwatch measurement buffer values should also be shown with last value at the top


1. Stopwatch buffer order numebrs, greatest should be at the top.
2. UA accelerationmeasurement should use 2 optical gates and calcluate acceration based on object lenght. That should also be in the experiment settings. 
3. Propose additional physics experiments to inlcude

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. return UA mesnurement description text as it was, do not change
2. New experiment modes cause restart
3. Disable wifi scanning if wifi is turned off


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Main menu top items are beneath the screen header, centre vertically on area beneath the header
2. Free fall does not calculate anything when blocked and unblocked
3. Free fall measurement display values go outside the measurement screen section
3. Buffer value numbering stops incrementing at 51

1. Main menu  items are still beneath the screen header, lover and centre vertically on area beneath the header
2. Stopwatch buffer order number stops incrementing after 10
3. Free fall sends values to buffer but does not show anything in the measurement value section

1. Main menu  items are still beneath the screen header, lover and centre vertically on area beneath the header
2. Free fall sends values to buffer but does not show anything in the measurement value section

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Make the main menu buttons wider so text is not cropped
2. Make the main menu buttons vetically centered beneath the header
3. There are no mesurement calculations and explanations in the center measurement screen section
4. Make the buffer value section a bit wider, so it touchjes the center masurement area section

1. Make the buffer value section a bit narrower, so teh control button footer fits without scrooling
2. Make the buffer value section values in two rows if thy exceed section widht
3. All Measurement values in the center measurement section have disappeared in the last revision
4. Lower the main menu buttons a bit


1. Free fall, inclined  UA, tachometer and CV buffer counter does not restart order numbering
2. Main menu, you've lowered the frame in witch the buttons are placed and not the actual buttons. The top row is now cropped. Make buttons shorter if needed

1. Stopwatch, add optical gate funcionality. Modes, no gate, gate A or gate A+B mode and a related mode selection in settings. Gate A mode, counter is started and stopped by gate A. Gate A+B, counter is started on Gate A and stopped on gate B. No gate, counter is started and stopped by on screen control. In A and A+B mode, start only arms the system, while gate activation records a lap. Enalbe simaulation in all modes. 
2. Uniform acceleration, modify , only 2 gates are used, simulation buttons should be Block A, Unblock A, Block B, Unblock B. 
3. Add “Free Fall”, “Inclined Plane”, and “Tachometer” into the controller MODES[] and AppController::enter_mode().
4. If wifi is off, do not scan wifi or do any wifi related steps
5. UA gate, remove D froma experiment, it is not used
6. Enforce uniform buffer cleaning on screen change for all experiments.
7. Re-introduce screen saver. 
8. Select all content on focus on any input field - input replaces the current value
9. Add welcome screen while starting for eq 3 sec. How to add company logo or a complete screen png?
10. All circular buffer values for all experiments should be reset when user returns on main menu. 
11. Introduce translations for all texts, and fonts that include language local charachters, greek characters and superscript used in formulas. 
12. Translation texts CSV export/import
13. Disable scrooling in screen sections
14. Inclined plane settings, ange setting should be an integer value, not floating point. 
15. Introduce real-time clock (RTC)
16. Add NTP when wifi is connected.
17. Introduce a web page with date grouped experiment data exports. 
18. Wifi export modal screen translations
X. Transfer esp language setting to AP web
X. Wifi AP captive portal - user redirect
X. Wifi AP is sometimes on even if modal screen is not on and AP toggle is off

X. rename AP web file names, add full experiment name
X. Bind export CSV control to propt for starting AP
X. Transfer esp language setting to AP web
X. move sd card read function to core 
X. simulate optical gate with switches
X. AP web translations.
X. csv export should indicate actual timestamp
X. fotogate, free fall and Tachometer do not react on simulation buttons, nothing is shown on screen
X. make csv export data have more sense
X. remove wifi icon in header
X. Export CSV control should export buffer values on experiment page on which is activated. 


X. Add erase all stored settings option in settings
X. Save CSV to SD and enable USB mass storage mode for file transfer
X. UA screen resets when arm toggle is off


Stopwatch 
- include mode name in header
- in mode gate A or gate A+B, start/stop button should be arm button, should not start the counter. 
- settings layout should look like other experiment settings, with mode selector, input field label and description
- if gate mode is selected, lap button should be replaced by export to CSV button


#1

Mode does not change when changed in settings. 
Make setting page in same format as in other experiments, same look and feel, with mode dropdown selection field
When Gate A is selected, show only Gate A simulation button, when A+B, show both, when no gate mode, do not show gate buttons


#2 

Export csv does not export experiment buffer values.
In experiment value buffer add start and stop next to counter value

Make Arm in gate A and A+B mode a manual toggle button, while armed - lights green all time, experiment is reacting to gate change, if not - it is gray  no reaction and buffer write
Reset counter and buffer on mode change

Uniform acceleration
- Make simulation header buttons narrower, so they fit in the simulation button section
- when armed, block a and block b calculates first passing speed, then block b and unbloack b calculate second passing speed. Upon completion of unblock b, result, acceleration calculated, shown and logged 

 Write the uniform acceleration measurement data to circular buffer

RESOLVED - 4.Remove wifi icon shown in header
RESOLVED - 5.CSV export is not possible beacuse extender is in input mode [E][Expander][esp_io_expander.c:0081](esp_io_expander_set_level): Pin[4] can't set level in input mode
RESOLVED - Issue with expander on screensaver start


1.Stopwatch does not react to optical gates
2.Tachometer, no ecvents are shown in history on gate activation
3.Keep simulation buttons on screen when simulation if off and animate them green as corresponding gate signal is active - Causes issues, posponed for later
4.Add csv export on screen confirmation and clear experiment data
5. Add ESP tyme sync (if time sync is enabled in settings) with user computer time when AP is connected
6. Introduce diagnostic logging 

OK - Stopwatch - if Gate A is activated before the experiment is armed, on arming the counter will start.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR THE FUTURE:
Translations in json?
Experimet presets saving and loading
Video sync feature (audio, light on wifi timestamp)
I2C executor implementation - Causes issues, posponed for later
Add offline storage of files to Chronos-Desktop, make app compare, yynchonize and copy files on connection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

X.Make AP usable without locking the user in modal screeen
X.Screen display is sometimes garbled.
